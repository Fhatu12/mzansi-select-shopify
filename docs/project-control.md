# Project Control Update - Slice 21HG

Date: 2026-05-28

## Objective
Classify all current live Shopify products into defined store departments and document mappings without mutating store data.

## Execution summary
- Verified live theme visibility context for `mzansiselect.myshopify.com` with live theme `#162429075681`.
- Executed read-only Admin API export using authenticated CLI domain `sikhwarigroupdev.myshopify.com`.
- Captured raw export artifacts (JSON and CSV) under the required WINQA artifacts route.
- Export result returned zero products (`productsCount: 0`), so no per-product department mapping could be performed.
- Produced slice classification document with full department list, zero-count mapping state, and follow-up recommendations.

## Decision
Status: blocked by empty product dataset in authenticated Admin store context.
Recommendation: confirm target Admin store/catalogue linkage, then rerun Slice 21HG classification against the store that contains live catalogue products.

## Project Control Update - Slice 21HG-B (Public Storefront Catalogue)

Date: 2026-05-28

### Objective
Classify all live customer-facing products into departments using the public storefront catalogue after Admin API returned zero products in Slice 21HG.

- Extracted product fields (`title`, `handle`, `product_type`, `vendor`, `tags`, first variant `price`) for classification support.
- Classified every live product into exactly one primary department.
- Produced mapping report: `docs/catalogue/slice-21hg-b-public-product-department-classification.md`.
